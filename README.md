# Test
Initial repository for learning Git

I\ll be deleting this repo at some point after I learn github and have some experience with git

I also want to do the actual github git course as opposed to just this helo-world thing.

It's ok that I'm making typos.  They are because this keyboard has a weird layout and I\ll be testing the VC features anyway.

## Todo
I also need to look at the propper formatting for a .md file
